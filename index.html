          <h2>Have you heard that bringing a new dog home is like bringing home a baby?</h2>
          <h3>Well, after having done both, it kind of is!</h3>
          <p> They are a lot of work, and there is a learning curve to overcome so that both your family and your new dog happily coexist.</p>
          <p>Topics we'll discuss in our meeting include</p>
          <p>Home setup * crate training * potty training * reading dog body language * first skills to teach your dog * socialization * nutrition * recommended products * recommended local trainers and classes</p>

          <h2>Meet Adina</h2>
          <p>I have always had dogs and always loved dogs for as long as I can remember. If the dog dies (or gets hurt, or gets sad, or if someone is mean to them) in the movie, count me out! If there's a cute dog and a cute baby, I'm likely staring at your dog!</p>
          <p>Since living in Colorado, I have volunteered with local dog rescues, fostered dogs, as well as both worked and volunteered at a local training facility working with it's board and train clients and taking care of kennels and dogs.</p>
          <p>My dog, Fiona, is 6 years old and we spent the first 3 years of Fiona's life going to every positive reinforcement training class, meetup, and puppy social that our community offered, and took agility classes as well!</p>

          <h2>Why I started Fido</h2>
          <p>Combining my personal experiences with what I have learned through working with these rescues and trainers, I noticed a gaping hole in services offered to new dog owners. There are great trainers available and great local pet stores for sourcing all your needs, but there really wasn't any good way for an individual or family to learn how best to prepare and incorporate their new furry family member into their lives and homes and to really set both person and pup up for success. After speaking with lots of people, I learned just how daunting getting a new dog can be and I wanted to change that! And so Bringing Fido Home was born!</p>
